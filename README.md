# WEBP OBLITERATOR

## Introduction 

**Webp obliterator is a racist program developed for the sole purpose of cleansing your downloads folder (or any folder you direct it to) of those nasty ass webp files, and makes them a cool png file. This program is made by a stupid ass programmer who doesn't know what he's doing yet, but has chatgpt to help him.**

## Dependencies

1. A computer - one that works preferably.

2. Python 3 - This is **needed** for this to work properly, as its a python program.
3. Pillow (PIL) - This is a python library that allows Webp obliterator to work with images.
4. WatchDog - This is a python library that allows Webp obliterator to watch a certain directory for events, that being downloads with a ".webp" extension.
